    "Gambler_intro_desc": "So you want to gamble your roubles? Well, you've come to the right place. I'm known as the Gambler around these parts of Tarkov and I can help you get started on your journey on scoring it big. But first, I have a few tasks to test your skill, complete them and you'll be rewarded handsomely. Before Tarkov became the trechoroous and dangerous warzone it is today, I had a lavish casino with many tables to wage bets, but that is now gone. My precious poker chips are scattered around Tarkov and I need you to find them for me. They can be found anywhere in Tarkov, lately I've hear they are scattered in loot stashes. Once you have one, come back to me and I'll have new gambles you can spend that chip on.",
    "Gambler_intro_success": "I see you found a poker chip, I don't care if you stole it off a scav or found in a pile of trash, you have it and that's all that matters. Welcome to the gambling life kid. I have few new barters and items you can purchase with your new hard earned poker chips. Find more in the future and you can spend them here. Good luck out there.",

He's been causing me trouble and I need him gone. I'll reward you handsomely if you can take him out. He's usually found at the Customs location near dorms or the new gas station. Good luck out there. You can keep his flimsy golden TT, I'll reward you with something better if you can finish the job.",
    "Gambler_reshala_success": "I see you've taken care of Reshala, good job soldier. You can keep his crappy golden TT, I have a better reward for you. This weapon is Reshala's most prized possession I stole a few years back, when he was still a small time crook. I think you'll find it useful in your future endeavors. Good luck out there.",
